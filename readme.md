# Converting files with pandoc
This is a guide on how to convert files to markdown with pandoc

Pandoc is a very versatile tool which allows conversion of multiple document formats. 

To simplify running pandoc, we will make use of Google Colab notebooks. 

To begin, go to https://colab.research.google.com/ 
Use of Colab is free. Note - tThere are limitations on the free version, but we will not reach these for our conversion purposes. 

On the Colab example home page, select "File", then "Open Notebook"

There is a Tab for "Github"; select that tab and paste 
```
https://github.com/WCSCourses/format_convert
```
into the search bar under "Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user" 

After a brief search, you will see
```
Convert_to_md-2.ipynb
```
below "Path". Click on "Convert_to_md-2.ipynb"

You will see the conversion notebook open.

In order to run the cells, you will need to login with your Google account (it is free to make an account).
